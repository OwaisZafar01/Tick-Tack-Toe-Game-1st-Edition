Tic Tac Toe Game Implementation in Python

This Python script implements a classic Tic Tac Toe game, where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid until one player wins by getting three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or the game ends in a draw.

Description:
The game is represented by a 3x3 grid stored in a nested list structure. Each cell in the grid can hold either a 1 or a 2, representing Player 1 or Player 2 respectively. The code iterates through the grid to check for winning conditions or a draw.

How It Works:
The script checks for winning conditions in rows, columns, and diagonals.
If any of these conditions are met, it declares the corresponding player as the winner.
If none of the winning conditions are met and all cells are filled, the game is declared a draw.
Key Features:
Modularity: The code is structured using if-elif statements, making it easy to understand and modify.
Readability: Variable names and comments are used to enhance readability and comprehension.
Scalability: While the script is designed for a 3x3 grid, it can be extended to larger grids with minimal adjustments.

Usage:
To use the Tic Tac Toe game, simply run the script in a Python environment. Players can take turns marking spaces until the game concludes with either a win or a draw.

Example:

game = [[1, 2, 1],
        [2, 1, 1],
        [1, 1, 2]]

Check for winning conditions and declare the winner or a draw
Outputs "PLAYER 1 won" in this scenario
